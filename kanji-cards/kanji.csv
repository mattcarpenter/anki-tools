"毛 (kanji)","N4","4-3","","Fur","Meaning mem:<br/>Fur and fur are the same as each other, so the meaning of this kanji should be simple. This can also mean hair, too, though more like furry hair. HINTS Just make sure you're studying your radicals, otherwise it won't be as simple as I'd hoped.<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>With fur, wisp your imagination to a land where there are stalks of fur all around, just like a big tall grassy field (except instead of grass, it’s fur). You’re surrounded by the black fur, the wind is blowing. Imagine yourself touching the long fur and smelling it. What does it feel / smell like? Now it’s time to get rid of it. There’s just too much hair! To get rid of it, you’ll need to mow (もう) it down with a lawn mower. Imagine yourself starting up the lawn mower, and taking it around, mowing down the hair. Hear the sound of the mower in your head (they’re loud and distinct). The important thing is to imagine yourself mowing everything. Key is to think “fur → In the fur → getting rid of the fur → mow the fur,” in that order. That’ll get you to mow, which will help you to remember the on’yomi. HINTS Smell the fur as you mow it down. Feel it flying everywhere. It's giant, so it must be pretty intense. Make it more intense to help yourself to remember the reading of this kanji better.<br/><br/>Readings:<br/>On’yomi もう Kun’yomi け Nanori None<br/><br/>Radicals:<br/>毛 Fur","","kanjionly N4 4-3"
"糸 (kanji)","N4","4-3","","Thread","Meaning mem:<br/>The thread radical and thread are the same in looks as well as in meaning. HINTS This is why it's good to make sure you know your radicals.<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>You have some thread... what's the first thing you do with it? You take it and put it in your mouth, and start sucking it down like spaghetti. You have decided to eat (いと) the thread. HINTS Think about how it tastes. Think about how it feels in your throat. Let it get caught on your teeth and around your tongue. It's a weird feeling having thread in your mouth, and you want to use that weird feeling to remember you're going to eat it.<br/><br/>Readings:<br/>On’yomi し Kun’yomi いと Nanori None<br/><br/>Radicals:<br/>糸 Thread","","kanjionly N4 4-3"

"玉 (kanji)","N4","4-3","","Ball","Meaning mem:<br/>The king has something in his hand that he's dropping... but it bounces too!

If not, imagine the kanji itself bouncing the drop (the ball) over and over again, then laying some hoops like a pro.<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>Think of someone curled up in a ball. It is someone you know / someone famous named “Tom” (たま). HINTS So, who's in a ball?

"光 (kanji)","N4","4-3","","Sunlight","Meaning mem:<br/>You see a triceratops in the distance. But, it's odd. It's perfectly pi shaped (that is, circular). Some kind of piceratops, if you will. The reason they are this shape is because they want to absorb as much sunlight (or just light is fine, too) as possible. They evolved to be round so they don't have any corners casting a shadow. HINTS Absorbing sunlight is natural for reptiles, after all. And a round one can absorb even more light. Imagine it sitting in a round spot of sun, enjoying the warmth. What a rare sight you've come across!<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>As you watch this majestic beast absorbing sunlight, suddenly several dozen feral (こういち)s burst from various hiding spots, spears in hand. Oh no! Those こういちs are hunting this rare piceratops! HINTS Imagine many different (but also kind of the same) こういちs attacking and throwing spears at the piceratops. But, because it was able to charge up in the sunlight, it uses its powers to shoot light in all directions, rendering all the こういちs momentarily blind, allowing it to escape.<br/><br/>Readings:<br/>On’yomi こう Kun’yomi ひかり, ひか Nanori None<br/><br/>Radicals:<br/> Triceratops 兀 Pi","","kanjionly N4 4-3"
