You should run.<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>The only way to keep this dirt alligator from dragging you under the earth and eating you is to feed it cheese (ち). That way it won't lead you to a horrific death under the earth by dragging you under and spinning you around until you eat dirt (literally).

No? Oh, you're thinking of that big studio knock off. That's okay, whatever makes you remember the laws of prefectural rule.<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>This small lion's prefecture is being protected by Ken (けん) the samurai because the lion is too small to protect all of this land himself.

People are quite amazed by this mystical creature you’ve found, though, which is pretty cool.<br/><br/>Readings:<br/>On’yomi ず, と Kun’yomi え, はか Nanori None<br/><br/>Radicals:<br/>口 Mouth メ Treasure 冫 Ice","ちず<br/>ずがこうさく<br/>としょかん<br/>ずかん","地図<br/>図画工作<br/>図書館<br/>図かん","kanji-writing-N4-4-1"
"kanji-key-館","館","N4","4-1","","Public Building","Meaning mem:<br/>Eating on this roof is a bear, which is how you know this is a public building. The law says that all bears are allowed to eat on the roofs of public buildings. In Japan at least, I don't know where bears are supposed to eat in wherever you're from. HINTS Picture a public building, like a museum or a library, and look at the roof. There's a bear eating up there! And it's smiling and waving to you!<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>All public buildings must serve bear needs thanks to the monumental law passed by Genghis Khan (かん). Genghis Khan knew that bears weren't treated well by humans, so he made sure all public buildings were at least partially bear accessible. HINTS The next time you see a public building, think, ""Thank you Genghis Khan.""

You wish others could see them. ""That's it,"" you decide. ""It's time to show the world. I'm going to make my fins public!""<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>You head out into the public where everyone can see your fins, but... things have changed. All people are the same. There are thousands of こういちs walking around, and they all stare at you (though they pretend like they aren't). HINTS Remember, whenever we see the reading こう, think of こういち, a founder of WaniKani. We'll keep it consistent, so over time you should develop a character around こういち that you learn to love or hate. How long have you been hiding in private with your fins? The public areas have changed, and all the people have become こういちs. One mother こういち--pushing a baby こういち--looks up and stares at your fins.

"kanji-key-園","園","N4","4-1","","Garden","Meaning mem:<br/>You examine the mouth of a zombie and find a small garden in there. There are even benches... it looks like a park. HINTS Zombies are dead, so I guess their mouths have all the things garden plants crave. Their mouths are like compost piles, if you think about it.<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>You look closer at the garden and suddenly everything ends (えん). HINTS Oh. The zombie probably bit down on your head and now it's the end for you. At least you were looking at a nice garden at the end of it all...<br/><br/>Readings:<br/>On’yomi えん Kun’yomi その Nanori None<br/><br/>Radicals:<br/>口 Mouth Zombie","こうえん<br/>どうぶつえん<br/>ゆうえんち<br/>ようちえん","公園<br/>どう物園<br/>ゆう園地<br/>ようち園","kanji-writing-N4-4-1"

How useful, unlike some husbands, I'd imagine.<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>What do all husbands love? Food (ふう)! Can you hear your future husband? He’s saying,” Fooooood!

HINTS You're standing above your wife, trying to figure out what she's making with her brush on the ground. If you have a real wife in real life, picture her doing this right now.<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>Your wife is drawing your cyborg (さい) on the ground. Oh no... now your wife is making kissy faces at the cyborg drawing. HINTS Okay, so your wife may be in love with the cyborg monstrosity you created a while ago.

"kanji-key-特","特","N4","4-2","","Special","Meaning mem:<br/>This cow temple is special. This cow must have been very important to have an entire temple dedicated to it. HINTS Picture a temple dedicated to a single cow. All of the people who come and worship here have a special place in their hearts for the cow.<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>This cow is special because it belonged to Tokugawa (とく) Ieyasu, Japan's first shougun and uniter of Japan! He's a super important figure in Japanese history. You should absolutely look him up and read a bit about him (when you're caught up on these lessons, that is).

Why am I thinking out loud?"" HINTS Think, think, think. Think about this rice paddy heart.<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>You think this heart is from a sheep (し). It's big and covered in wool.

"kanji-key-料","料","N4","4-2","","Fee","Meaning mem:<br/>You have a rice ladle that's specifically for paying the rice fee. Each scoop of something has an extra fee tacked on, so when you use a material, there's a fee you have to pay in that material as well. HINTS Imagine ladling up a nice big scoop of rice and then seeing the little fee ladle next to it. Ugh. The material fee.<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>One day, the fee ladle is suddenly the size of row (りょう) boat oars! What! You're supposed to pay a row boat sized fee now?! HINTS That's a lot of material you have to give up every time you want to eat some rice.

"kanji-key-洋","洋","N4","4-3","","Western Style","Meaning mem:<br/>A sheep rides a tsunami in classic Western style. And by Western style I mean the sheep is dressed in a cowboy outfit and has put a saddle atop the tsunami wave to ride it. It’s a tsunami rodeo and this crazy sheep is riding that tsunami wave in classic Western style. This kanji also means ocean, because presumably the people from the ""West"" who have ""Western Style"" came from across the ocean. They're the ""Ocean People"" in this sense. You'll want to be familiar with this meaning for vocab later on. HINTS Imagine how ridiculous a sheep would look all decked out in Western style cowboy gear. Now imagine it riding a tsunami wave as it screams, “Baa~ baa~ baa~!”<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>After a whole day of riding this tsunami, the sheep is hankerin’ for some Western style food. This sheep loves yogurt (よう). And its favorite flavor is Western style apple pie yogurt. America loves its apple pie and this sheep loves Western style apple pie flavored yogurt. HINTS Imagine yourself eating this Western style apple pie yogurt. It tastes just like apple pie only creamier and fruitier. Taste the sweet yogurt in your mouth as you imagine yourself scarfing some down.<br/><br/>Readings:<br/>On’yomi よう Kun’yomi None Nanori None<br/><br/>Radicals:<br/>氵 Tsunami 羊 Sheep","せいようりょうり<br/>ようがく<br/>ようふく<br/>せいよう<br/>とうよう","西洋料理<br/>洋がく<br/>洋服<br/>西洋<br/>東洋","kanji-writing-N4-4-3"

This should stop people from stealing all of your clothes!<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>A few days later you're with a friend when you recognize the clothes they're wearing. You grab it, rip it off, and scream, ""F**k (ふく) you!"" There is your moon stamp! These are your clothes!! HINTS Your friend turns red and tries to pull the clothes back, ""F**k you!"" they yell.

The eagle’s egg needs a soft warm place to incubate, and your pile of clothes is the perfect place. HINTS Look at the eagle and her egg sitting atop your clothes.

"kanji-key-短","短","N4","4-3","","Short","Meaning mem:<br/>If you shoot a tall stalk of beans with an arrow, the bean plant will go from tall to short. When the beans are hit with that arrow, it severs the plant in two, and you are left with a stalk of beans that is much shorter than before. HINTS Picture yourself shooting this arrow. Imagine yourself nocking the arrow to the bow, and pulling the string back. That bean plant is not short enough, and you’re going to do something about it.<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>All this shooting of arrows to make the bean plants more short is taking a long time. Since you’re out in the sun, you’re starting to get a tan (たん). After the day is finally over, your tan is really, really dark. HINTS Imagine yourself being out in the sun for so long that you get an amazing tan. Your skin feels warm all over from all the sun you were getting throughout the day.

"kanji-key-毛","毛","N4","4-3","","Fur","Meaning mem:<br/>Fur and fur are the same as each other, so the meaning of this kanji should be simple. This can also mean hair, too, though more like furry hair. HINTS Just make sure you're studying your radicals, otherwise it won't be as simple as I'd hoped.<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>With fur, wisp your imagination to a land where there are stalks of fur all around, just like a big tall grassy field (except instead of grass, it’s fur). You’re surrounded by the black fur, the wind is blowing. Imagine yourself touching the long fur and smelling it. What does it feel / smell like? Now it’s time to get rid of it. There’s just too much hair! To get rid of it, you’ll need to mow (もう) it down with a lawn mower. Imagine yourself starting up the lawn mower, and taking it around, mowing down the hair. Hear the sound of the mower in your head (they’re loud and distinct). The important thing is to imagine yourself mowing everything. Key is to think “fur → In the fur → getting rid of the fur → mow the fur,” in that order. That’ll get you to mow, which will help you to remember the on’yomi. HINTS Smell the fur as you mow it down. Feel it flying everywhere. It's giant, so it must be pretty intense. Make it more intense to help yourself to remember the reading of this kanji better.<br/><br/>Readings:<br/>On’yomi もう Kun’yomi け Nanori None<br/><br/>Radicals:<br/>毛 Fur","かみのけ<br/>まゆげ<br/>もうふ<br/>けいと<br/>ようもう","かみの毛<br/>まゆ毛<br/>毛ふ<br/>毛糸<br/>羊毛","kanji-writing-N4-4-3"

You take it and put it in your mouth, and start sucking it down like spaghetti. You have decided to eat (いと) the thread. HINTS Think about how it tastes. Think about how it feels in your throat. Let it get caught on your teeth and around your tongue. It's a weird feeling having thread in your mouth, and you want to use that weird feeling to remember you're going to eat it.<br/><br/>Readings:<br/>On’yomi し Kun’yomi いと Nanori None<br/><br/>Radicals:<br/>糸 Thread","けいと<br/>いとくず","毛糸<br/>糸くず","kanji-writing-N4-4-3"

He's bouncing a ball HINTS This kanji looks just like a king bouncing a ball, no? If not, imagine the kanji itself bouncing the drop (the ball) over and over again, then laying some hoops like a pro.<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>Think of someone curled up in a ball. It is someone you know / someone famous named “Tom” (たま). HINTS So, who's in a ball?

"kanji-key-光","光","N4","4-3","","Sunlight","Meaning mem:<br/>You see a triceratops in the distance. But, it's odd. It's perfectly pi shaped (that is, circular). Some kind of piceratops, if you will. The reason they are this shape is because they want to absorb as much sunlight (or just light is fine, too) as possible. They evolved to be round so they don't have any corners casting a shadow. HINTS Absorbing sunlight is natural for reptiles, after all. And a round one can absorb even more light. Imagine it sitting in a round spot of sun, enjoying the warmth. What a rare sight you've come across!<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>As you watch this majestic beast absorbing sunlight, suddenly several dozen feral (こういち)s burst from various hiding spots, spears in hand. Oh no! Those こういちs are hunting this rare piceratops! HINTS Imagine many different (but also kind of the same) こういちs attacking and throwing spears at the piceratops. But, because it was able to charge up in the sunlight, it uses its powers to shoot light in all directions, rendering all the こういちs momentarily blind, allowing it to escape.<br/><br/>Readings:<br/>On’yomi こう Kun’yomi ひかり, ひか Nanori None<br/><br/>Radicals:<br/> Triceratops 兀 Pi","ひかる<br/>ひかり<br/>にっこう<br/>かんこうち<br/>つきのひかり","光る<br/>光<br/>日光<br/>観光地<br/>月の光","kanji-writing-N4-4-3"
