That's because it's the morning, which is when the sun and moon switch over. Those crosses are making sure the sun stays high in the sky for the rest of the day. HINTS Imagine a sun attached up in the sky with two crosses, which act as scaffolding, and the moon gradually fading off to the right as the morning wears on.<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>Every morning you have Asahi (あさ) beer for breakfast.

The sun gets really tired, same as anyone else – so when night rolls around the sun excuses itself and goes to sleep. It’s a valid excuse. HINTS Imagine you’re the sun, working all day. Of course you get tired. This is a good excuse to go to bed at night and get some rest. Feel how sore and hot and sweaty and exhausted you are after a hard day’s work of being the sun.<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>Since you’re the sun, it’s pretty bright, so before you excuse yourself for the night, you’re wearing Ray-Ban (ばん) sunglasses.

It doesn't do anything except for every day right at noon, when it tells you the time. ""Hey guyz, it's noon, mmk?"" HINTS Really try to imagine this giant shrimp on the sun as a normal thing that happens, without fail, every day. The shrimp also tells the time right at noon, every day (so important you stress remembering that it's noon, not some other time). Maybe you could have him sing a ""noon song"" in your imagination as well.<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>At noon, the shrimp also puts on its high heels (ひる) to get ready for the evening, where it wants to make sure it looks good for the other shrimp he/she meets later on. HINTS Right after the shrimp's announcement, imagine it struggling to put on heels, while sitting on the sun. This shrimp is almost bigger than the sun, actually, so all its struggles with its heels are easy to see.<br/><br/>Readings:<br/>On’yomi ちゅう Kun’yomi ひる Nanori None<br/><br/>Radicals:<br/>尺 Shrimp 日 Sun 一 Ground","ひるやすみ<br/>ちゅうしょく<br/>ひる","昼休み<br/>昼食<br/>昼","kanji-writing-N4-2-3"

On top of all this, it's night. HINTS If it helps, you can come up with a reason why he's outside in the winter at night. Also, why is he wearing a lid on his head? Probably because he's protecting his people from something that comes at night.<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>Question is, what is he protecting them from during the night? Turns out, it's the Yankees (や) baseball team. They're out for blood, and only the leader can protect us.

Something that's in front of you is before you, after all. HINTS Perhaps it's some kind of magic, but you don't care. Why are these strange objects always in front of me? Why won't they stay put?

No matter what, these objects are always in front.<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>You're going crazy with these things in front of you all the time.

It then lines up with the cross, and at that moment, your alarm goes off, waking you up. You check the alarm clock, and instead of displaying the time, it just says EARLY and FAST on it, flashing in big red letters and alternating.<br/><br/>Reading mem:<br/>To remember the そう reading we use the word ""soul."" When you're forced to get up fast and early you can feel it in your soul (そう). You're so tired and it's so early, your soul cries out, ""Please don't make me go this fast this early.
